# Histopathologic Cancer Detection

## Description
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for the "Histopathologic Cancer Detection" project, which is part of a Kaggle competition. The goal of this project is to develop algorithms that can accurately identify metastatic cancer from small sections of pathology scans. This involves analyzing a large dataset of high-resolution pathology scan images, labeled for the presence or absence of metastatic tissue, to detect cancerous patterns efficiently.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is part of the Kaggle competition and consists of high-resolution pathology scan images. It can be downloaded directly within the notebook using the provided code cells.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
- Required Python libraries: [List here the main libraries required, e.g., NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow/Keras]

## Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine, then install the required Python packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MedGhassen/Histopathologic-Cancer-Detection
cd Histopathologic-Cancer-Detection
```

## Usage
To run the notebook, navigate to the cloned repository's directory and start Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab:

```bash
cd Histopathologic-Cancer-Detection
jupyter notebook
```

Open the `Histopathologic_Cancer_Detection.ipynb` notebook and run the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and the results.
